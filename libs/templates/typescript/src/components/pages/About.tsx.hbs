    <p className="mb-3">Crab is a command-line-interface (CLI) meant to supplement Create React App, and provide additional utility to generate code, install ubiquitous libraries, and generally make the developer experience easier.</p>

    <p className="mb-3">The interface is intended to be as simple as possible, providing reasonable defaults, and everything "just works".</p>

    <p className="mb-3">You can find out more about Crab at <a href="https://www.crab-cli.info">its website</a>.</p>
